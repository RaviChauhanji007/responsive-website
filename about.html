				<h1>Student Accommodation : A Major Challenge</h1>
				<p>Most of the Higher Education Institutes in India face a common challenge that is building a high capacity on- campus accommodation. Not having an on-campus accommodation leads to students rushing to off-campus accommodations where their security gets compromised.</p>
				<p>Here’s where Avantika Palace comes in, giving the institutes professionally managed student housing option off campus, boosting their own inventory. Avantika's properties are usually located in close vicinity to the higher education institutes in an area, thus partnering with Placio gives the institutes an advantage as with Placio, the security and well being of the students living off campus is assured.</p>
				<p>Also, institutes can partner with Palace to stay connected with students even when they return to their accommodation thus promoting an event or communicating a message to student becomes a piece of cake.</p>
